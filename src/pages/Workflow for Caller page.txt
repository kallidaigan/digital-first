Workflow for Caller page 
(1) Client calls access number to Remote Telehealth
(2) Call routed to agent via Twilio
Scenarios
(3) Agent or administrator   
opens search dialog to find client 
May have to edit details - need for informal "consult"? in dB 
If client not present - creates new client - consider "Caller new/Edit" page 
Probably no need to delete caller - keep on dB 
?How to deal with aliases/multiple clients ? merge callers

(a) has no current clients => Selects to deal with immediately
(b) Agent has current client => adds to waitlist 

(4) Agent selects caller from waitlist ? probably no further need to edit 
Could be done via search dialog
